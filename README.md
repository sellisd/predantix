# Predantix

The web extension is a helper for the pedanlte/pedantix games that submits a 
number of common words shortening the boring initial phase of trying simple
words.

It is based on the [beastify webextension example](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/main/beastify). The extension icon is from [FreePNGImg.com](https://www.freepngimg.com/icon/1000261-cloud-emoji-icon-download-free)
